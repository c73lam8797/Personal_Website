# charmainelam.com : Personal Website

## What is this?
* A complete rework of my personal website. The first version can be found at https://c73lam8797.github.io/Personal_Website_V0/
* The first version of the site was created to challenge myself to learn and create reusable components without other UI libraries. Now that I am more familiar with React, more UI libraries have been added to improve the styling
